    "- **Shared Encoder:** The SentenceTransformer model defined in Task 1 is used as the shared backbone. This encoder processes input sentences and produces embeddings.

    "  * For sentence classification, the method selects a pooling strategy (like mean, max, or using the cls token) to condense the entire token sequence into a single vector, which is then fed into the classifier head.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Freezing the Entire Network:**\n",
    " When the entire network is frozen, weights remain unchanged, and no training is conducted. This approach saves computational resources, as it eliminates the need for updates during training. If the pretrained model's domain is similar to ours, freezing the network can produce effective results, particularly with small datasets, as it helps avoid overfitting. However, this method lacks flexibility and may not perform well unless the pretrained model is extremely close to your domain.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. **Freezing Only Transformer Backbone**\n",
    "The transformer backbone's weights are fixed, allowing the pretrained model to act as a feature extractor. The task-specific heads are trained to map these extracted embeddings to the specific categories or values relevant to our tasks. This method accelerates training compared to fine-tuning the entire model. It is particularly beneficial when dealing with small datasets, as it preserves the core features of the pre-trained model. This approach leverages the generalizability of pre-trained embeddings while customizing the model to specific tasks. It’s beneficial when the new tasks differ in finer details that the last layers can adapt to. However, if our task diverges significantly from the original training context of the model, performance may degrade.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Freezing only one of the task-specific heads**\n",
    "   If one of the task-specific heads is frozen, it enables targeted adjustments to the model’s performance. This strategy is beneficial when one task is well-tuned and stable, while another still requires optimization. By freezing the head of the well-performing task, we can focus training efforts on areas that need improvement, enhancing overall efficiency. This approach is particularly valuable when dealing with tasks of varying complexity and datasets of differing sizes. For example, if a task with limited data has already achieved satisfactory results, freezing its corresponding head prevents overfitting and conserves the integrity of its performance. Simultaneously, it allows continued training for the task with more abundant data, where further performance gains are possible. On the other hand, if one task has significantly more data, training the model jointly without adjustments could lead to dominance by the task with more data, potentially skewing the model's ability to learn from the smaller dataset effectively. Freezing the well-trained task might help mitigate this by allowing more training focus on the underrepresented task. Freezing the head for the more stable or adequately trained task also means fewer parameters require updates during training, which enhances computational efficiency and helps balance the model’s learning across its various tasks.\n",

    "    * **Learning Rate Adjustments:** We start with a smaller learning rate to preserve the core features of the model and prevent the model from deviating too much from its initial training. As we unfreeze more layers, we may slightly increase the learning rate to allow the model to adapt more freely to the specifics of the new task.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Preventing Overfitting:** By only updating the weights of the final layers, there's a risk of overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data. To combat this, unfreezing additional layers allows the model to learn more generalizable features rather than just memorizing the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Adapting to New Domains:** If the new task diverges significantly from the data used in pre-training, it might be beneficial to unfreeze more layers. This approach allows the model to adjust its internal representations more extensively to better suit the new domain.\n",
