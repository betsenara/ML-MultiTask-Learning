    "Freezing the entire network  or partially freezing have advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Freezing the Entire Network:**\n",
    " When the entire network is frozen, weights remain unchanged, and no training is conducted. This approach saves computational resources, as it eliminates the need for updates during training. If the pretrained model's domain is similar to ours, freezing the network can produce effective results, particularly with small datasets, as it helps avoid overfitting. However, this method lacks flexibility and may not perform well unless the pretrained model is extremely close to your domain.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. **Freezing Only Transformer Backbone**\n",
    "The transformer backbone's weights are fixed, allowing the pretrained model to act as a feature extractor. The task-specific heads are trained to map these extracted embeddings to the specific categories or values relevant to our tasks. This method accelerates training compared to fine-tuning the entire model. It is particularly beneficial when dealing with small datasets, as it preserves the core features of the pre-trained model. This approach leverages the generalizability of pre-trained embeddings while customizing the model to specific tasks. Itâ€™s beneficial when the new tasks differ in finer details that the last layers can adapt to. However, if our task diverges significantly from the original training context of the model, performance may degrade.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Freezing only one of the task-specific heads**\n",
    "   If one of the task-specific heads is frozen, it enables targeted adjustments to the modelâ€™s performance. This strategy is beneficial when one task is well-tuned and stable, while another still requires optimization. By freezing the head of the well-performing task, we can focus training efforts on areas that need improvement, enhancing overall efficiency. This approach is particularly valuable when dealing with tasks of varying complexity and datasets of differing sizes. For example, if a task with limited data has already achieved satisfactory results, freezing its corresponding head prevents overfitting and conserves the integrity of its performance. Simultaneously, it allows continued training for the task with more abundant data, where further performance gains are possible. On the other hand, if one task has significantly more data, training the model jointly without adjustments could lead to dominance by the task with more data, potentially skewing the model's ability to learn from the smaller dataset effectively. Freezing the well-trained task might help mitigate this by allowing more training focus on the underrepresented task. Freezing the head for the more stable or adequately trained task also means fewer parameters require updates during training, which enhances computational efficiency and helps balance the modelâ€™s learning across its various tasks.\n",

    "1. When selecting a pretrained model, I would prefer a robust option like BERT, which has been extensively trained on diverse and large datasets. Additionally, choosing a model pretrained on data that closely aligns with my specific domain is crucial to leverage transferrable features effectively.\n",
    "2. First we freeze the backbone and unfreeze the task specific layers to adapt the response to the new task. Depending on the performance or overfitting concerns we gradually unfreeze starting from the top layers. use a small learning rate. As I keep unfreezing we would decrease the learning rate.\n",
    "3. When utilizing transfer learning, selecting a pre-trained model that is already trained on vast datasets have several advantages like drastically reducing the need for additional data and shortening training times. However, fine-tuning such a model requires careful consideration.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    * **Gradual Unfreezing:** It's crucial to unfreeze layers progressively to avoid catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses previously learned information from the original training set. We begin with the last few layers, as they are more specialized to the task at hand, and we gradually work our way to earlier layers if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Learning Rate Adjustments:** We start with a smaller learning rate to preserve the core features of the model and prevent the model from deviating too much from its initial training. As we unfreeze more layers, we may slightly increase the learning rate to allow the model to adapt more freely to the specifics of the new task.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Preventing Overfitting:** By only updating the weights of the final layers, there's a risk of overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data. To combat this, unfreezing additional layers allows the model to learn more generalizable features rather than just memorizing the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Adapting to New Domains:** If the new task diverges significantly from the data used in pre-training, it might be beneficial to unfreeze more layers. This approach allows the model to adjust its internal representations more extensively to better suit the new domain.\n",

However, in our multi-task scenario where batches contain mixed labels (both classification and NER), we cannot process the entire batch in a uniform manner.
